# random-password-generator

This is my first javascript code. It creates a randomly generated password according to what characters the user would like to use. 

A homework assignment given from Bootcamp to learn about Javascript.

## Functionality of Website

You are prompted with four questions to specify which characters you would like to use and how long you would like your password to be. 

After being given the prompts when hitting the "Generate Password" button, you are given a password that includes all of your specifications written to the page.

A correct length and at least one specification must be given or an error/alert will appear. 

Prompts are for a number, a special character, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.
